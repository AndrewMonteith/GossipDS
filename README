This project is implemented using java and should be tested on a Linux machine.
To compile the project use the shell script file provided.

We are querying the movie dataset provided in the assignment.

This toy network boasts the following features:
	- Casual update ordering using the gossip architecture.
	- The ability to query ratings, submit new ratings and update existing ratings using a client.
	- The network can also handle 1 fault since it sends mutation requests to 2 replicas if applicable.

I understand testing a network can be quite difficult hence I have included a number of unit tests within java.core.NetworkSimulator
which check the functionality of the network. Simply change `doFrontendTests` to true to run them. (Don't have this to true if you youself are testing the network)

To run the required components on the distributed network run:
java ds.core.NetworkSimulator

To run an instance of the client run:
java ds.client.Client
