To make sure that the system can handle f failures:
    We send the update request to f + 1 replicas.
    We send the request with the same ID's to say: "This is the same update request"
    When a replica is able to execute the request:
        - Executes the request and returns the timestamp

    The frontend waits for the f + 1 responses before letting the client continue.
        - Frontend updates it's timestamp with each response timestamp

    When a replica receives a gossip message with an ID in it's executed operations table:
        We merge the value timestamp with with the update log's timestamp (not the request one!)
